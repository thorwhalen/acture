# acture

> Get AI-agentic help building a command-dispatch architecture — one schema, and the palette, hotkeys, AI tools, MCP, and tests fall out of it.

acture is **a development tool** for building, migrating to, and maintaining a command-dispatch architecture in TypeScript/React apps. Define an operation once as a command; it becomes a command palette entry, a keyboard shortcut, an AI tool call, an MCP server tool, a macro step, an end-to-end test action, an undo entry, and a telemetry event — and, via the [`acture`](https://pypi.org/project/acture/) PyPI client, a Python call.

It is delivered primarily as **skills, patterns, and codemods** an AI agent uses to write command dispatch *into your project* — adapted to your stack and your preferences. The `acture-*` npm packages are an **optional accelerator**: ready-made, tested implementations the agent can reach for instead of hand-writing similar code.

**You can use acture without adding a single `acture-*` dependency to your project.** Whether you take on a dependency is always your explicit, per-piece choice — see [`docs/positioning.md`](docs/positioning.md), the canonical statement of what acture is and what it asks of you.

## Install (optional — the accelerator packages)

You only install what you decide to reuse. Every package is independently optional; the agent-written path needs none of them.

```bash
pnpm add acture                  # core registry + dispatcher + schema bridge (optional even this)
pnpm add acture-state-zustand    # state adapter (or acture-state-redux)
pnpm add acture-palette-react    # command palette UI (on cmdk)
pnpm add acture-hotkeys          # keyboard shortcuts (on tinykeys)
pnpm add acture-mcp-server       # MCP server projection
pnpm add acture-ai-vercel        # AI tool definitions (on the Vercel AI SDK)
pnpm add acture-migration        # strangler-fig adoption primitives
pnpm add acture-telemetry        # observe every dispatch via a sink
pnpm add acture-undo             # patch-based undo/redo over a PatchCapableAdapter
# …plus acture-forms-autoform and acture-forms-rjsf for parameterized commands.

# Dev / CI tooling:
pnpm add -D acture-build-tier              # build-step @stable/@experimental/@internal/@deprecated mirror
pnpm add -D acture-cli                     # `acture compare-schemas` / `acture snapshot` CLI
pnpm add -D acture-devtools                # embeddable <Inspector /> for dev builds
pnpm add -D acture-e2e-playwright          # macro / e2e sequence engine + Playwright fixture
pnpm add -D acture-test-property           # fast-check property tests over the registry
pnpm add -D eslint-plugin-acture-migration  # ESLint rules: stale wrapMutation, .describe() discipline
```

Python:

```bash
pip install acture  # MCP client facade — Mapping[str, Command] over any acture-mcp-server
```

> The 18 sub-packages publish unscoped as `acture-*` — the `@acture` npm scope was unavailable. The MCP adapter is published as `acture-mcp-server` because the unscoped `acture-mcp` collided with an unrelated project. `acture` is the single namespace on both npm (the core registry) and PyPI (the Python MCP client).

## Status

**v1.13 — chain end (2026-05-15).** 19 npm packages live + 1 PyPI package (`acture`, the Python MCP client). 489 npm package tests + 41 example tests + 23 Python tests, all green. 26 agent skills + 7 reproducibility docs. Phases 0–4 of the original v1 plan are complete; work since has been small, tracked increments. See [`docs/roadmap.md`](docs/roadmap.md) for the live status. Of the post-v1 candidates, the state adapters `acture-state-jotai` and `acture-state-valtio` remain; `acture-sandbox` now ships the isolation-only extension seam (the `ExtensionRunner` port + in-process transport), with the real isolating transports still deferred.

Worked examples:

- [`examples/greenfield/graph-editor/`](examples/greenfield/graph-editor) — greenfield path; wires `acture-devtools`.
- [`examples/drop-in/`](examples/drop-in) — 5-minute bolt-on path.
- [`examples/migration/zustand-wrap/`](examples/migration/zustand-wrap) — strangler-fig path with side-by-side [`before/`](examples/migration/zustand-wrap/before) and [`after/`](examples/migration/zustand-wrap/after) apps; 6 wrapped commands + 2 graduated.
- [`examples/migration/redux-wrap/`](examples/migration/redux-wrap) — Redux Toolkit cart with `actureMiddleware` end-to-end. UI dispatch + palette dispatch converge on the same store, observed as one stream.

Agent skills live under [`.claude/skills/`](.claude/skills/): 21 `acture-*` (dev / foundation / per-consumer-surface) + 5 `migration-*` (strangler-fig workflow: `migration-diagnose` → `migration-plan` → `migration-scaffold` → `migration-wrap` → `migration-graduate`). Reproducibility references for each major package live under `docs/hand-written-*.md`.

### What's new since v1.5

- **v1.13** — `acture` on PyPI graduated from name-reservation placeholder to a real thin MCP-client facade per research-6. `ActureClient` (a `Mapping[str, Command]`), `Command`, `ActureError`, `stdio_transport` / `http_transport`. Cross-language semver is lockstep (driven by `scripts/sync-python-version.mjs`).
- **v1.12** — `acture-test-property`. fast-check arbitraries; random `CommandSequence`s replayed through the v1.7 sequence engine; invariants asserted end-of-sequence; shrunk counter-examples replayable verbatim.
- **v1.11** — `acture-telemetry` and `acture-undo`. Telemetry observes every dispatch via a configurable sink (optional `redact` / `sampler`). Undo is patch-based over a `PatchCapableAdapter`, transactions group N dispatches, `onEffect` routes effect lifecycle to the host.
- **v1.10** — `acture/require-param-describe` lint rule (Zod params missing `.describe()`) and an MCP spec-version pin test.
- **v1.9** — `acture-codemods` CLI/README polish + `docs/ai-codemod-recipe.md`; greenfield agent-track skills (`acture-greenfield-state-model`, `acture-greenfield-bootstrap`).
- **v1.8** — per-surface consumer skills for hotkeys, MCP, and AI.
- **v1.7** — `acture-e2e-playwright`; macros + e2e tooling under the same sequence engine (`docs/hand-written-command-sequence.md`).
- **v1.6** — core positioning review; `enableTierWarnings` moved to `acture-devtools`; `docs/hand-written-registry.md` + `acture-greenfield` skill.
- **v1.5** — repositioning + namespace migration (all `@acture/*` → unscoped `acture-*`).

What's next: see [`docs/roadmap.md`](docs/roadmap.md) for the forward plan and [`docs/next_session.md`](docs/next_session.md) for the active handoff.

## Two flexibility dimensions

acture adapts along two independent axes — and the agent keeps both open rather than defaulting one. (Full statement in [`docs/positioning.md`](docs/positioning.md).)

- **Core vs strangler-fig** — design command dispatch in from day one, or wrap it into an existing codebase incrementally and graduate over time.
- **Agent-written vs package-reuse** — have the agent write the integration into your project (zero acture dependency, maximum adaptability), or install an `acture-*` package (less code to own, tested — at the cost of a dependency). Decided per consumer, not per project.

## What it isn't

- **Not a framework you must depend on.** acture is a development tool first. An agent wielding its skills can stand up a full command-dispatch architecture in a project whose `package.json` never gains an `acture-*` line. Depending on a package is always your explicit, opt-in choice.
- Not a state library. acture ships an adapter interface (`StateAdapter<S>`) and reference adapters; your app keeps its existing state library.
- Not a React library. Core has zero React dependencies; React lives in adapter packages.
- Not opinionated about your UI kit or your tools. Bring your own design system, your own e2e runner, your own AI SDK — acture's per-tool packages each integrate *one* known-good choice, never the only choice.

## What does "acture" mean?

[Acture](https://www.oed.com/dictionary/acture_n) is primarily known as an obsolete term from the early 1600s that means 
action or the state of doing something. 

> "Love made them not; with acture they may be,
> Where neither party is nor true nor kind."
> 
> — William Shakespeare, *A Lover's Complaint* (line 185)

It has also been adopted in specialized movement fields to describe dynamic readiness.

The term "acture" was famously coined by [Moshe Feldenkrais](https://feldenkrais.com/about-moshe-feldenkrais/), the founder of the Feldenkrais Method, as a direct [critique of the traditional, static concept of "posture."](https://kinesophics.ca/freedom_and_maturity/)
In the context of the Feldenkrais Method and movement science, "acture" represents the [transition from viewing the body as a structure held in a fixed position](https://feldenkrais.com/posture-or-acture/) to viewing it as a system constantly prepared for action.
