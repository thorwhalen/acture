# acture architecture primer

You are working on **acture**, a TypeScript library implementing the command-dispatch architecture. This skill loads the conceptual model. Read carefully before starting non-trivial work.

## The three primitives

Acture is built on three interlocking primitives. They are not optional layers — they are the minimal framework.

1. **State model** — a typed schema over application state. Defines *what exists*. Acture is agnostic about the state library; an adapter interface (`StateAdapter<S>`) lets zustand, Redux Toolkit, Jotai, etc. plug in cleanly. Reference adapters: `acture-state-zustand` (Phase 1) and `acture-state-redux` (Phase 2).

2. **Command registry** — a centralized map from a string `id` to a `CommandRecord`. Defines *what can be done*. Every user-facing operation flows through `registry.dispatch(id, params, ctx?)`. Carries the rest of the metadata: title, description, parameters, when-clauses, keybindings, tier marker, atomic-or-handoff flag.

3. **Schema bridge** — connects application-level types (Zod by default) to JSON Schema for MCP tools, AI tool calling, and external consumers. `toJsonSchema(record)` is the primary export.

## The eight consumer surfaces

A single `CommandRecord` simultaneously serves:

1. **Command palette** (`acture-palette-react` + the `acture-palette-design` skill) + **keyboard shortcuts** (`acture-hotkeys` + the `acture-hotkeys` skill)
2. **AI tool calling** (`acture-ai-vercel` + the `acture-ai` skill) — schema → JSON Schema (or Zod pass-through) for LLM function calling
3. **MCP server** (`acture-mcp-server` + the `acture-mcp` skill) — `{name, description, inputSchema}` tool emission
4. **End-to-end testing** (`acture-e2e-playwright` + the `acture-e2e` skill) — same `dispatch(id, params)` used by tests at unit/component/E2E levels; an e2e test is a macro with assertions
5. **Telemetry** (`acture-telemetry` + the `acture-telemetry` skill) — observe every dispatch; configurable sink with optional sampler/redact
6. **Undo/redo** (`acture-undo` + the `acture-undo` skill) — patch-based history over a `PatchCapableAdapter`; transactions group N dispatches; host callback for effect lifecycle
7. **Macros** (the `acture-macros` skill + `docs/hand-written-command-sequence.md` — pattern, no package) — record/replay of `{commandId, params}` pairs
8. **Extensions/plugins** — third-party additions via the registry API

## Positioning: acture is a development tool first

**Read `docs/positioning.md` — it is canonical and governs every user-facing word.** The headline:

> acture is a place developers (human or agent) go to get AI-agentic help building, migrating to, and maintaining a command-dispatch architecture. It is delivered primarily as **skills, patterns, and codemods**; the `acture-*` npm packages are an **optional accelerator**, not the product. A developer must be able to use acture purely as a development tool with **no `acture-*` dependency added to their project** — unless they explicitly choose to.

Every engagement sits on **two independent dimensions** — keep both open, never collapse one into a default:

1. **Core vs strangler-fig** — is command dispatch designed in, or wrapped into an existing codebase incrementally? (The conceptual paper's three "positioning paths" — greenfield-pure, footprint-minimizer, strangler-fig — collapse onto this axis: the first two are *core*, the third is *strangler-fig*.)
2. **Agent-written vs package-reuse** — does the agent write the integration into the project (zero acture dependency, maximum adaptability), or install an `acture-*` package (less code to own, tested, at the cost of a dependency)? Decided **per consumer**, not per project.

**Standing rule:** whenever your task touches a consumer surface or a consumer-specific `acture-*` package, also load the **`acture-consumer-integration`** skill. It operationalises the positioning above; this primer only states it. When the task is standing up command dispatch in a *new* target project, load **`acture-greenfield`** — it operationalises the same positioning for the core primitive itself, backed by the `docs/hand-written-registry.md` reference (the registry is ~80 lines a project can own outright, with zero `acture-*` dependency).

## The rule of three — for users, not for us

> Soft heuristic for the application developer: an operation only earns formalization as a `defineCommand` entry once it is triggered from roughly three surfaces.

This is the central paper §6.2's heuristic, scoped correctly: it is guidance for the *application developer using acture* — a softening of YAGNI suited to multi-surface frontends. The journal nuances it already: because acture amortizes formalization across surfaces (palette, AI, MCP, macros, tests), the threshold is reached sooner and more naturally than under ad-hoc integration. Treat it as a guard against premature abstraction in *the user's app*, not as a rigid count and not as a gate inside acture.

**This rule does NOT apply to acture maintainers.** Earlier drafts of acture's own docs (and several historical reflections) turned the rule "inward" — "don't ship an acture feature until three real callers exist" — which is wrong: acture is the *tooling* that helps developers build command-dispatch architectures, so a callers-count gate would defeat the point. For what acture maintainers ship, the actual principles are YAGNI / wait for a concrete need, hard-don't #2 (no god-package), architecture-astronaut avoidance (§risks below), and the dev-tool-first principle. See [`docs/redesign_takeaways.md`](../../docs/redesign_takeaways.md) §6 for the canonical statement.

## The four risks (and mitigations)

From the central paper §6:

1. **Inner Platform Effect** — command metadata becoming a mini-language. *Mitigation:* keep the `CommandRecord` surface closed and small (see `acture-command-record-shape` skill). Metadata is data, not code.

2. **Premature generalization** — building extension points for hypothetical consumers. *Mitigation:* YAGNI / wait for a concrete named need; about 1/3 of features actually improve metrics (Microsoft data). For acture *users* this surfaces as the soft rule-of-three heuristic above; for acture *maintainers* it is enforced by hard-don't #2 (no god-package) and by the dev-tool-first principle — see [`docs/redesign_takeaways.md`](../../docs/redesign_takeaways.md) §6.

3. **Performance overhead** — dispatch indirection at hot paths. *Mitigation:* bifurcate. Dispatch is for human-frequency operations (ms–s); render-frequency operations (16ms frame budget) stay as direct calls.

4. **Architecture astronaut syndrome** — elaborate infrastructure that never gets used. *Mitigation:* immediate user value at every phase. If a phase doesn't ship user-facing value, it is a red flag.

## What you should NOT assume

- Acture does **not** ship a state library. It ships an adapter interface and reference adapters.
- Acture is **not** a React library. The core has zero React dependencies. React lives in adapter packages.
- Acture does **not** prescribe how to organize your existing app. The migration package wraps existing code; it doesn't replace it.
- The `kind` field's two values (`"atomic"` and `"handoff"`) are a **closed enum** for v1; do not add a third without three-caller validation.
- The migration package's four functions are it. `divertHandler` was scoped out per research-4.

## Where the canonical sources live

- **Conceptual:** `docs/command_dispatch_journal_article.md`
- **Positioning:** `docs/positioning.md` — canonical; governs every user-facing word (dev-tool-first, the two dimensions)
- **Forward plan + status:** `docs/roadmap.md` — what's done, what's next, what's deferred
- **Immediate handoff:** `docs/next_session.md`
- **v1 plan (historical):** `docs/v1_plan.md`
- **Execution (historical):** `docs/implementation_plan.md`
- **Don'ts:** `docs/redesign_takeaways.md` §3 (also the `acture-hard-donts` skill)
- **Research:** `docs/research/acture_research_{1..5} ...md` — load only what's relevant to your task

## When you've loaded this skill

You should now be able to answer for any acture task:
- Which primitive does this touch?
- Which consumer surfaces does this affect?
- Does this risk one of the four named anti-patterns?
- Does this honour the dev-tool-first positioning — could a developer do this with zero `acture-*` dependency?
- If it touches a consumer surface, did you also load `acture-consumer-integration`?

If you can't answer those, re-read the relevant section.
