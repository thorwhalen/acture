# acture roadmap & status tracker

The live forward-planning surface. `docs/v1_plan.md` and `docs/implementation_plan.md` are the *historical* v1 plan (phases 0–4, all complete); this file is what's true now and what's next.

**How work proceeds:** phases are over. Work is small, tracked increments. Each picks one or two items from "Next" or "Deferred", ships them, updates this file, and replaces `docs/next_session.md` with the following handoff.

Last updated: **2026-05-14** (v1.5 — repositioning + namespace migration).

---

## Status snapshot

- **15 packages** in the workspace. `acture@1.1.0` and `eslint-plugin-acture-migration@1.0.0` are **published on npm**; the other 13 (renamed `@acture/*` → `acture-*` in v1.5) are built, tested, and **not yet published**.
- **396 package tests + 41 example tests** green; all packages and examples build + typecheck.
- Canonical positioning is now written down (`docs/positioning.md`) and wired into the skills.
- 14 skills: 8 dev (`acture-*`), 5 migration-track (`migration-*`), 1 consumer-integration foundation (`acture-consumer-integration`).

---

## Done

### Phases 0–4 (the original v1 plan) — complete
Core, state adapters, all consumer adapter packages, the migration package + migration skill track, the tier system, CLI, devtools. See `docs/phase-*-reflection.md`.

### v1.1 – v1.4 increments — complete
DOM interception, RTK example, build-tier AST mode, deep schema diffs, the full research-4 §B.5 codemod set (5 codemods), `eslint-plugin-acture-migration` (`acture/no-stale-wrap-mutation`), and the deferred fresh-agent release-gate test. See `docs/v1_{1..4}-reflection.md` and `docs/fresh-agent-test-results.md`.

### v1.5 — repositioning + namespace migration — complete (this increment)
- **`docs/positioning.md`** written — canonical: acture is a development tool first, packages are an optional accelerator, the two flexibility dimensions (core vs strangler-fig; agent-written vs package-reuse), and the dev-tool-first principle (zero `acture-*` dependency unless explicitly chosen).
- **`acture-consumer-integration` skill** created — the foundational pattern for building a consumer in a target project. Dev skills (`acture-architecture-primer`, `acture-hard-donts`, `acture-palette-design`) updated to load it whenever a task touches a consumer surface; `acture-hard-donts` gained a positioning check (merge-ritual item #6).
- **Namespace migration** — all 13 `@acture/*` packages renamed to unscoped `acture-*` (the `@acture` npm scope was unavailable; flat naming also fits the "optional à-la-carte tools" positioning better). All imports, workspace deps, configs, examples, docs, and skills updated; lockfile regenerated; full workspace re-validated.
- **READMEs** — root, `packages/core`, and all 14 sub-package READMEs carry the dev-tool-first framing. `AGENTS.md` updated.

### npm publishing — partial
`acture@1.1.0` + `eslint-plugin-acture-migration@1.0.0` live. The `@acture` org could not be created (namespace taken); decision was to go unscoped — see v1.5 above.

---

## In progress / immediate next

**`acture` core positioning-alignment review** — `docs/next_session.md`. Audit `packages/core` against `docs/positioning.md`: (A) is core genuinely the minimal primitive, or has accelerator/adapter logic crept in? (B) is the agent-written path *reproducible*, not just asserted — could an agent hand-write an equivalent registry from the skills + core's source? Refactor only what the audit justifies. The `CommandRecord` stays closed at 15 fields.

Also unblocked, owner-discretion: **publish the 13 renamed packages** to npm.

---

## Next

**Macros + e2e testing tooling.** These two consumer surfaces are structurally near-identical — a sequence (or DAG) of `{commandId, params}` pairs, with assertions in the e2e case (journal §3.4, §3.7: "an end-to-end test is a macro with assertions"). They were the least-tooled surfaces. Build them per the positioning:

- **Core enables; packages are separate and optional; each gets a consumer skill.** The command-sequence *concept* (record / compose / replay) is something the agent can hand-write following a documented pattern. Specialized, tool-bound implementations are *separate optional packages*.
- **`acture-e2e-playwright`** — a separate package with reusable e2e code bound specifically to **Playwright**. (Playwright is the tool choice here; the consumer skill must still document the agent-written path and that other runners are valid choices — per `acture-consumer-integration`.)
- **Macros** — a record/replay tool. Decide during that session whether it ships as a package, a pattern + skill, or both — guided by the positioning and the rule of three.
- Each surface gets a **consumer-integration skill** (`acture-e2e`, `acture-macros`) building on `acture-consumer-integration`.

Open design question to settle that session: macros and e2e share so much structure that a single command-sequence substrate underneath both may be the right shape — rather than two unrelated packages. Evaluate before committing.

## Deferred / backlog

Valid, not scheduled. Pick up when prioritized.

- **Codemods README/CLI polish** — from the v1.4 fresh-agent test (`docs/fresh-agent-test-results.md`): the README's `npx acture-codemods` invocation story, undocumented per-codemod `--option` keys, undocumented `--manifest`/`--files-from`, and the ambiguous "No files matched" error. Full candidate list parked in `docs/backlog/codemods-polish-and-tier-mirror.md`.
- **`.d.ts` mirror of resolved tier values** — optional `acture-build-tier` polish. Parked in the same backlog file.
- **AI-codemod-recipe doc** — research-4 recommendation #8: a doc showing how to prompt an agent to author a one-off codemod. Parked in the same backlog file.
- **Per-surface consumer skills** — `acture-consumer-integration` is the foundation; per-surface skills exist only for the palette (`acture-palette-design`). Hotkeys, MCP, AI, e2e, macros, telemetry, undo, extensions still need consumer skills. (e2e + macros are covered by the "Next" item above; the rest are backlog.)
- **Greenfield agent-track skills** — the skill set is currently weighted toward migration and toward acture's internals. There is no greenfield "agent, help me build a command-dispatch app from scratch" track. Worth building once the consumer-skill family fills in.

---

## Post-v1 (deferred, not committed)

Per `docs/v1_plan.md` §"Post-v1" — none ship without explicit user direction **and** three concrete callers (rule of three):

- **`acture-undo`** — patch-based undo, transactions, effect queue. `Result<R>` already reserves `patches?` / `effects?`; `PatchCapableAdapter` is implemented by the state adapters.
- **`acture-telemetry`** — middleware logging every dispatch.
- **`acture-sandbox`** — membrane-pattern third-party extension sandboxing.
- **`acture-test-property`** — fast-check arbitraries derived from command param schemas; random command sequences asserting state invariants. (Note: overlaps the macros/e2e "Next" item — revisit scope when that lands.)
- **`acture-state-jotai`, `acture-state-valtio`** — additional reference `StateAdapter<S>` implementations.
- **Python companion** (`acture` on PyPI) — research-6 was never executed. Re-run research-6 before considering it.
