# acture roadmap & status tracker

The live forward-planning surface. `docs/v1_plan.md` and `docs/implementation_plan.md` are the *historical* v1 plan (phases 0–4, all complete); this file is what's true now and what's next.

**How work proceeds:** phases are over. Work is small, tracked increments. Each picks one or two items from "Next" or "Deferred", ships them, updates this file, and replaces `docs/next_session.md` with the following handoff.

Last updated: **2026-05-15** (v1.12 — `acture-test-property` pull-forward from Post-v1).

---

## Status snapshot

- **19 packages** in the workspace. **`acture-test-property`** is new this increment (v1.12), pulled forward from Post-v1. Pending changeset: `acture-test-property` (`minor` at debut).
- **489 package tests + 41 example tests** green (+29 from `acture-test-property`); all packages and examples build + typecheck.
- Canonical positioning is now written down (`docs/positioning.md`) and wired into the skills. **Rule-of-three rescoped** (`docs/redesign_takeaways.md` §6): the soft heuristic applies to acture *users* deciding when to formalize a command, not to acture *maintainers* deciding what to ship.
- **25 skills**: 20 `acture-*` (dev / foundation / consumer-surface — palette / hotkeys / MCP / AI / macros / e2e / telemetry / undo / **test-property** consumer skills + `acture-greenfield` and its two sub-skills) and 5 `migration-*`.
- Six reproducibility / recipe docs: `hand-written-registry.md`, `hand-written-command-sequence.md`, `hand-written-telemetry.md`, `hand-written-undo.md`, **`hand-written-test-property.md`**, and `ai-codemod-recipe.md`.

## Done

### Phases 0–4 (the original v1 plan) — complete
Core, state adapters, all consumer adapter packages, the migration package + migration skill track, the tier system, CLI, devtools. See `docs/phase-*-reflection.md`.

### v1.1 – v1.4 increments — complete
DOM interception, RTK example, build-tier AST mode, deep schema diffs, the full research-4 §B.5 codemod set (5 codemods), `eslint-plugin-acture-migration` (`acture/no-stale-wrap-mutation`), and the deferred fresh-agent release-gate test. See `docs/v1_{1..4}-reflection.md` and `docs/fresh-agent-test-results.md`.

### v1.5 — repositioning + namespace migration — complete (this increment)
- **`docs/positioning.md`** written — canonical: acture is a development tool first, packages are an optional accelerator, the two flexibility dimensions (core vs strangler-fig; agent-written vs package-reuse), and the dev-tool-first principle (zero `acture-*` dependency unless explicitly chosen).
- **`acture-consumer-integration` skill** created — the foundational pattern for building a consumer in a target project. Dev skills (`acture-architecture-primer`, `acture-hard-donts`, `acture-palette-design`) updated to load it whenever a task touches a consumer surface; `acture-hard-donts` gained a positioning check (merge-ritual item #6).
- **Namespace migration** — all 13 `@acture/*` packages renamed to unscoped `acture-*` (the `@acture` npm scope was unavailable; flat naming also fits the "optional à-la-carte tools" positioning better). All imports, workspace deps, configs, examples, docs, and skills updated; lockfile regenerated; full workspace re-validated.
- **READMEs** — root, `packages/core`, and all 14 sub-package READMEs carry the dev-tool-first framing. `AGENTS.md` updated.

### npm publishing — complete
All 15 packages are live on npm (2026-05-14). The `@acture` org could not be created (namespace taken) → went unscoped `acture-*`. One further collision surfaced at publish time: the unscoped name `acture-mcp` was already taken by an unrelated project, so the MCP adapter was renamed to **`acture-mcp-server`**.

### v1.6 — core positioning-alignment review — complete (this increment)
Audit of `packages/core` against `docs/positioning.md`. Findings and outcome (full write-up: `docs/core-review-reflection.md`):

- **Import boundary: clean.** Core depends only on `zod` (peer). Zero React, zero state libraries — verified across all source files (hard-don'ts #6 holds).
- **Promise A (core is the minimal primitive): one extraction.** Seven of eight source files are genuinely primitive (registry/dispatcher, schema bridge, state-adapter interface; the `when` DSL is defensibly primitive — the dispatcher must evaluate the closed `when` field). The outlier was **`tier-warnings.ts`** — `enableTierWarnings` is dispatch *instrumentation* (it monkey-patches `registry.dispatch` to `console.warn`), structurally identical to `acture-devtools`'s `instrumentRegistry`. **Moved to `acture-devtools`.** `acture` core ↔ `acture-devtools` both `minor`.
- **Promise B (the agent-written path is reproducible): the central gap, now closed.** The skills taught acture's *design* and `acture-consumer-integration` covered the hand-written path for *consumers*, but nothing made the **core primitive itself** reproducible without reverse-engineering ~1000 lines of source. New artifacts: **`docs/hand-written-registry.md`** (a legible, ~80-line, zero-dependency registry+dispatcher reference) and the **`acture-greenfield` skill** (walks an agent through standing up the core primitive in a new project — hand-write vs. install `acture` core as a deliberate per-project choice). `acture-architecture-primer` updated to load `acture-greenfield` for greenfield tasks.
- `CommandRecord` unchanged — stays closed at 15 fields.

### v1.7 — macros + e2e testing tooling — complete (this increment)
The two least-tooled consumer surfaces — macros and e2e — built per the positioning. Full write-up: `docs/v1_7-reflection.md`.

- **Step 1 design decision (settled with the user via `AskUserQuestion`):** the shared command-sequence concept is **not** a package. The fork was (A) a shared `acture-sequence` substrate, (B) two independent packages, (C) a hand-written reference doc + only the tool-bound package. **Chose C.** Rule of three (no third concrete *code* caller of a substrate yet), hard-don't #2 (a substrate package layering macros + e2e + assertions courts god-packaging), and the journal's own "the macro layer is a thin consumer, not a new primitive" (§3.7) all pointed the same way — and it matches the v1.6 `docs/hand-written-registry.md` precedent exactly. Macros: **pattern + skill, no package** (also user-confirmed).
- **`docs/hand-written-command-sequence.md`** — the reproducible reference: `recordSequence` / `replaySequence` / `replayTest` over `{commandId, params}` sequences, ~60 lines a project owns outright. The sibling of `docs/hand-written-registry.md`.
- **`acture-e2e-playwright`** — the one new package (the *tool-bound* piece). Two layers kept separate: a pure, Playwright-free sequence engine that mirrors the reference doc line-for-line, and the Playwright glue (`dispatchInPage`, `clickCommand`, `commandSelector`, `replaySequenceInPage`, `replayTestInPage`, plus a `test` fixture at `acture-e2e-playwright/fixture`). Playwright is type-only in the main entry; the runtime import is isolated in `./fixture`. 23 tests. `minor` changeset.
- **`acture-macros` + `acture-e2e` consumer skills** — both build on `acture-consumer-integration`. `acture-macros` documents the no-package, hand-write-from-the-doc path; `acture-e2e` covers the test-pyramid compilation strategy, the Playwright package, and that Cypress / Vitest browser mode / other runners are equally valid (agent-written) choices.
- `acture-architecture-primer` and `acture-consumer-integration` updated: the eight-consumer-surface list and the per-tool table now reference the shipped macros/e2e artifacts instead of marking them "post-v1" / "planned".

### v1.8 — hotkeys / MCP / AI consumer skills — complete (this increment)
Three per-surface consumer skills, for the three remaining consumer surfaces that already have shipping packages. Full write-up: `docs/v1_8-reflection.md`.

- **Step 1 decision (settled with the user via `AskUserQuestion`):** picked **per-surface consumer skills** over codemods polish / greenfield agent-track skills, scoped to **hotkeys + MCP + AI** — the three surfaces with shipping packages (`acture-hotkeys`, `acture-mcp-server`, `acture-ai-vercel`). telemetry / undo / extensions were deferred: no shipping packages yet (telemetry & undo are post-v1), so their skills would be agent-written-path-only and less consistent — a later increment.
- **`acture-hotkeys` skill** — keyboard shortcuts as a registry projection. The tool-library choice (tinykeys / react-hotkeys-hook / custom), agent-written vs the `acture-hotkeys` package, first-registered-wins conflict resolution, fire-time `when`-clause evaluation, the input-aware default, modal scoping.
- **`acture-mcp` skill** — the registry as an MCP server. The two-layer split (pure projection vs transport glue), the SDK/transport choice, tier semantics, the deterministic `@deprecated` banner, function-`when` exclusion, errors-as-data, and the prompt-injection guardrails (hard-don'ts #5/#10).
- **`acture-ai` skill** — the registry as LLM tool definitions. The SDK choice and the schema-projection fork (pass Zod through vs project to JSON Schema), errors-as-data, function-`when` exclusion, the prompt-injection guardrails, and the "an AI tool-call sequence is a macro" cross-reference.
- All three build on `acture-consumer-integration`, follow the `acture-macros` / `acture-e2e` template for shape and tone, and document both the agent-written and package-reuse paths with the tool-library choice framed as the user's.
- **Consistency updates:** `acture-architecture-primer`'s consumer-surface list and `acture-consumer-integration`'s "See also" now point at the new skills.
- Skills + docs only — no package code changed, no changeset. Full workspace build / typecheck / test re-verified green.

### v1.9 — codemods polish + greenfield agent-track skills — complete (this increment)
Two backlog increments shipped in one session (the user delegated the scope call: "fix what's fixable autonomously"). Full write-up: `docs/v1_9-reflection.md`.

**Part A — codemods README/CLI polish + AI-codemod-recipe doc** (closes the `docs/backlog/codemods-polish-and-tier-mirror.md` file):
- **`acture-codemods` CLI** — the ambiguous "No files matched" error (v1.4 fresh-agent finding #4) is now three distinct messages: no `--target`/`--files-from` given, a path that does not exist (likely a typo), a path with no `.ts`/`.tsx`/`.jsx` files. `--help` gained Modes (`--list`/`--manifest`) and Exit codes sections. +3 CLI tests (52 → 55). `minor` changeset.
- **`acture-codemods` README** — rewritten: documents every `--option` key for all five codemods, `--manifest` vs `--list`, `--files-from`, exit codes, and the from-a-clone invocation. (Finding #1 — the `npx` 404 — was resolved by reality: `acture-codemods` is published on npm; the README now states that and adds the contributor invocation.)
- **`docs/ai-codemod-recipe.md`** — research-4 recommendation #8: the `Codemod` contract, the four-point conservative-codemod discipline, a ts-morph `run` skeleton, a prompt recipe, and how to run a one-off codemod (throwaway script vs. drop into the package).
- **`.d.ts` tier mirror — deliberately NOT built.** Deferred v1.2 → v1.8 with no concrete consumer; tier filtering is runtime-only (`registry.list({ tiers })`), nothing consumes tier at the type level. Building it would be speculative infrastructure without a named need. Instead, the `acture-build-tier` README caveat was rewritten to make the deferral explicit-with-rationale.
- **`.changeset/README.md`** — fixed: it still described the dropped `fixed` group and the stale "0.x quirk". Now describes independent versioning and post-1.0 semver.

**Part B — greenfield agent-track skills** (the per-step skills below the `acture-greenfield` foundation):
- **`acture-greenfield-state-model`** — Step 1 in detail: the four hard constraints on the state shape (JSON-serializable, typed slices, normalized, stored-vs-derived), the deterministic counter-in-state id-generation pattern, the `StateAdapter` seam, what does NOT belong in state.
- **`acture-greenfield-bootstrap`** — the concrete file-by-file walk-through of the foundation's four-step sequence, grounded in the `examples/greenfield/graph-editor` worked app: the three core files (`state.ts` → `registry.ts` → `commands/index.ts`), the "every mutation through dispatch" acceptance criterion + its `rg` audit, the ordering discipline, the recurring hand-write-vs-install decision points.
- **Consistency update:** `acture-greenfield` now points at both sub-skills (intro + Step 1 + See also).

### v1.10 — `.describe()` schema-quality lint rule + MCP spec-version pin — complete (this increment)
Two small, autonomous backlog items surfaced by research-6 (the user picked "smaller backlog items" over pulling a post-v1 item forward). Full write-up: `docs/v1_10-reflection.md`.

- **`acture/require-param-describe`** (new ESLint rule in `eslint-plugin-acture-migration`) — flags top-level fields in a `defineCommand({ params: z.object({...}) })` schema whose value expression has no `.describe(...)` in its method chain. Zod → JSON Schema is lossy; without `.describe()` every downstream consumer (MCP tool inputs, AI function-calling tool args, autoform / rjsf form adapters) is left with a parameter that has no semantic hint. Conservative detection (tracks the `defineCommand` and `z` bindings, only fires when both are recognised and `params` is structurally `z.object({...})`). +19 tests. `minor` changeset. The plugin now hosts both migration-specific and schema-quality rules; the historical `-migration` package suffix was kept to avoid a breaking rename (a god-package-of-one new plugin would have been speculative infrastructure — hard-don't #2).
- **MCP spec-version pin** (`packages/mcp/src/spec-version.test.ts`) — pins `EXPECTED_PROTOCOL_VERSION = '2025-11-25'` and asserts the SDK's `LATEST_PROTOCOL_VERSION` matches and `SUPPORTED_PROTOCOL_VERSIONS` still contains the older dates we interoperate with. When the SDK ships a new spec date the test fails, surfacing the upgrade as the deliberate, semver-major decision the roadmap calls for rather than an accidental transitive-dep pickup. README documents the policy + the test's upgrade checklist. +2 tests. `patch` changeset on `acture-mcp-server`.

### v1.11 — `acture-telemetry` + `acture-undo` pull-forward — complete (this increment)
Two new packages pulled forward from Post-v1 by explicit user direction. Full write-up: `docs/v1_11-reflection.md`.

- **`acture-telemetry`** (new package, `1.0.0`) — observe every dispatch via a configurable sink. Optional pass-through `redact` and `sampler` callbacks (single-function shapes, no mini-DSL). One built-in `consoleSink` for reference; multi-destination is user-side composition (`sink: (r) => { a(r); b(r); }`). Errors-as-data preserved end-to-end. Telemetry never breaks dispatch (sampler/redact/sink each in defensive `try`/`catch`). +18 tests. `minor` changeset. Reference: `docs/hand-written-telemetry.md`. Consumer skill: `acture-telemetry`.
- **`acture-undo`** (new package, `1.0.0`) — patch-based undo/redo over a `PatchCapableAdapter`. `createUndoHistory(adapter, registry, options?)` returns `{ undo, redo, canUndo, canRedo, clear, transaction, entries, dispose }`. Observes the adapter's `setStateWithPatches` calls and groups them by dispatch boundary; `transaction(fn)` groups N dispatches. Partial-failure semantics: mid-transaction failure leaves prior mutations applied; the entry is still pushed; caller can `undo()` to rewind. Effects flow through optional `onEffect(effect, { isUndo, isRedo })` host callback at apply/undo/redo lifecycle points — acture-undo never enacts effects itself. +19 tests. `minor` changeset. Reference: `docs/hand-written-undo.md`. Consumer skill: `acture-undo`.
- **Step 1 shape decisions (settled with the user via `AskUserQuestion`):** telemetry `redact` = pass-through callback (not declarative key-list); telemetry `sampler` = function (not fraction); undo effects = host callback `onEffect(effect, { isUndo, isRedo })` (not typed enum); transaction failure = partial stays applied (not auto-rewind). All four landed on the simpler, more flexible options.
- **Composition:** both packages wrap `registry.dispatch` via the same monkey-patch pattern as `acture-devtools`'s `instrumentRegistry` and `enableTierWarnings`. Install order = install order; dispose in reverse install order. No core change was needed.
- **Consistency updates:** `acture-architecture-primer`'s consumer-surface list (#5 telemetry, #6 undo/redo) now references the shipped artifacts; `acture-consumer-integration`'s per-tool table gained telemetry and undo rows and its "See also" enumerates the new skills; `acture-state-adapter` no longer marks undo as "post-v1".

### v1.12 — `acture-test-property` pull-forward — complete (this increment)
New package pulled forward from Post-v1 as part of the autonomous v1.12 + v1.13 chain. Full write-up: `docs/v1_12-reflection.md`.

- **`acture-test-property`** (new package, `1.0.0`) — fast-check arbitraries over the command registry; random `CommandSequence`s replayed via `acture-e2e-playwright`'s `replaySequence`; invariants asserted end-of-sequence. On a counter-example, the thrown `PropertyTestFailure` carries the shrunk failing sequence (replayable verbatim through `replaySequence`) and the invariant name. +29 tests. `minor` changeset. Reference: `docs/hand-written-test-property.md`. Consumer skill: `acture-test-property`.
- **Shape decisions (settled autonomously per next_session.md):** tool-library = **fast-check** (the dominant JS property-testing library; jsverify unmaintained; hand-roll loses shrinking). Zod-to-arbitrary mapping = **in-package mapper** (the spec-listed `@fast-check/zod` package does not exist on npm; verified with `npm view @fast-check/zod`). Mapper subset = the JSON-Schema-representable subset acture's `toJsonSchema` already serializes: `string / number / boolean / literal / enum / array / object / union / optional / nullable`. Unsupported types throw `UnsupportedZodTypeError` loudly — silent skipping would mean a "valid" failing sequence the user couldn't reproduce. Invariants run **end-of-sequence**, matching `replayTest`'s shape.
- **Builds on**, doesn't re-derive, the v1.7 sequence engine: imports `replaySequence`, `CommandSequence`, `SequenceStep` from `acture-e2e-playwright` (the package depends on the pure sequence module, not on Playwright runtime). Tested against both `acture-state-zustand` and `acture-state-redux` adapters in the same suite.
- **No god-package.** One fast-check binding only. No Vitest/Jest matchers, no HTML report, no CI integration, no per-step invariants, no `fc.commands` stateful-model surface — each is its own future package if real demand surfaces (hard-don't #2).
- **Consistency updates:** roadmap status snapshot updated; this section added; `acture-test-property` skill registered as the eighth-and-a-half consumer surface variant (it does not add a 9th surface — it is the e2e surface's property-test variant).

## Next

**Pick the next increment from Deferred / backlog or the remaining Post-v1 list.** No item is pre-selected. With test-property shipped, the remaining Post-v1 items are: the **Python companion** (research-6 spec'd, unblocked — scheduled as v1.13), **`acture-sandbox`** (membrane-pattern third-party extension sandboxing), and additional state adapters (`acture-state-jotai`, `acture-state-valtio`). The deferred-but-not-rejected backlog has only the `.d.ts` tier mirror and the per-surface skills for extensions (no package yet). Pull-forward decisions are the user's; surface options when this increment is scheduled.

---

## Deferred / backlog

Valid, not scheduled. Pick up when prioritized.

- **`.d.ts` mirror of resolved tier values** — ⏸️ **deliberately deferred, not just unscheduled.** Considered in v1.9 and explicitly not built: zero concrete callers, tier filtering is runtime-only, nothing consumes tier at the type level. Rule-of-three gated — waits for a concrete type-level tier consumer. The `acture-build-tier` README documents the deferral and its rationale.
- **Per-surface consumer skills** — `acture-consumer-integration` is the foundation; per-surface skills now exist for the palette (`acture-palette-design`), macros (`acture-macros`), e2e (`acture-e2e`), hotkeys (`acture-hotkeys`), MCP (`acture-mcp`), and AI tool calling (`acture-ai`). Still missing: **telemetry, undo, extensions** — but these have no shipping packages (telemetry & undo are post-v1; v1.11 pulls those forward), so their skills are best written after the packages exist. Revisit once v1.11 ships.
- **Deeper greenfield agent-track skills** — the foundation (`acture-greenfield`) plus the two agent-track sub-skills (`acture-greenfield-state-model`, `acture-greenfield-bootstrap`, added v1.9) now cover the greenfield sequence end-to-end. No specific gap is scheduled; add further sub-skills only if practice surfaces one.

---

## Post-v1 (deferred, not committed)

Per `docs/v1_plan.md` §"Post-v1" — none ship without explicit user direction. (Earlier drafts of this section gated post-v1 promotion on a "three concrete callers" rule of three; that was a misapplication — see `docs/redesign_takeaways.md` §6. Post-v1 items pull forward on user direction plus the standard maintainer principles: hard-don't #2, dev-tool-first, single accelerators.)

- ~~**`acture-undo`** — patch-based undo, transactions, effect queue.~~ ✅ Shipped v1.11.
- ~~**`acture-telemetry`** — middleware logging every dispatch.~~ ✅ Shipped v1.11.
- **`acture-sandbox`** — membrane-pattern third-party extension sandboxing.
- ~~**`acture-test-property`** — fast-check arbitraries derived from command param schemas; random command sequences asserting state invariants.~~ ✅ Shipped v1.12.
- **`acture-state-jotai`, `acture-state-valtio`** — additional reference `StateAdapter<S>` implementations.
- **Python companion** — **research-6 is done** (`docs/research/acture_research_6 …`) and gives this a tight, ready shape: a *thin MCP-client facade* package (`acture` on PyPI if available, else `acture-client`), ~300 LoC, dict-like in the `dol`/`py2mcp` idiom, zero hard Pydantic dependency. **The server side already ships** as `acture-mcp-server` — only the thin Python *client* remains. Explicitly **not** a Pydantic-codegen SDK or OpenAPI emitter in v1 (those are post-companion, for human — not agent — consumers). No longer blocked on research — pull forward whenever wanted. Note: research-6 was written against an assumed `StableCommand` name; map it to the real `CommandRecord` / `defineCommand`.

### Smaller items surfaced by research-6 — both now shipped

Both items below were picked up in v1.10:

- **`.describe()` discipline as a lint rule** — ✅ Shipped as `acture/require-param-describe` in `eslint-plugin-acture-migration`. The plugin's name kept its historical `-migration` suffix (renaming an already-published package is breaking; creating a new one-rule plugin would have been a god-package-of-one — hard-don't #2).
- **Pin the MCP spec version in CI** — ✅ Shipped as a `vitest` test in `packages/mcp/src/spec-version.test.ts` that asserts the SDK's `LATEST_PROTOCOL_VERSION` matches `EXPECTED_PROTOCOL_VERSION = '2025-11-25'`. An SDK upgrade that bumps the spec date now surfaces as a deliberate, semver-major decision.
